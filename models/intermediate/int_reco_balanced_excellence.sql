RECOMMENDATION STRATEGY: Balanced Excellence Across All Dimensions

METHODOLOGY:
This model identifies beers that perform exceptionally well across ALL rating dimensions
(aroma, taste, appearance, palate) rather than just overall rating. It seeks "complete" 
beers with no weak points, ensuring a consistently excellent experience across all 
sensory aspects.

BUSINESS LOGIC:
- Calculates a composite "balanced_score" by averaging aroma, taste, appearance, and palate ratings
- Identifies the "weakest link" (minimum dimension score) to avoid beers with any poor aspects
- Measures "dimension_consistency" to prefer beers with uniform excellence vs. uneven performance
- Requires complete data across all four dimensions for fair comparison
- Higher review threshold (15+) due to more stringent data requirements

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Perfect for discerning beer enthusiasts who want excellence across all sensory experiences
and aren't willing to compromise on any aspect of beer quality

PROS:
- Identifies truly exceptional beers with no weak points
- Appeals to sophisticated palates seeking complete experiences
- Reduces risk of disappointment in any particular aspect
- More comprehensive quality assessment than single-metric approaches

CONS:
- Excludes beers that might be outstanding in one dimension but average in others
- Higher data requirements may eliminate some excellent beers with fewer reviews
- May be overly conservative and miss innovative or distinctive beers
- Complex methodology may be harder to explain to stakeholders

RANKING METHODOLOGY:
1. Primary: balanced_score DESC (average of all 4 dimensions)
2. Secondary: min_dimension_score DESC (strength of weakest aspect)
3. Tertiary: review_count DESC (statistical reliability)

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Each beer must have â‰¥15 reviews with complete data across all dimensions
- No beer recommended if any single dimension scores below average
