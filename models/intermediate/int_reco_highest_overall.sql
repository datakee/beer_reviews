RECOMMENDATION STRATEGY: Highest Overall Rating

METHODOLOGY:
This model identifies the top 3 beer recommendations based on the highest average overall 
rating scores from reviewers. This is the most straightforward approach - simply finding 
the beers that consistently receive the highest overall ratings.

BUSINESS LOGIC:
- Focuses purely on the "review_overall" field as the primary quality indicator
- Requires minimum 10 reviews per beer to ensure statistical reliability
- Uses review count as a tiebreaker when overall ratings are equal
- Assumes that reviewers' overall ratings are the best single indicator of beer quality

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Best for customers who want proven crowd-pleasers with broad appeal

PROS:
- Simple, intuitive methodology that's easy to explain
- Directly reflects customer satisfaction
- Clear ranking system

CONS:
- May miss beers that excel in specific dimensions but have average overall scores
- Could be biased toward mainstream styles that appeal to many reviewers
- Doesn't account for personal taste preferences across different beer characteristics

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Each recommended beer must have â‰¥10 reviews for reliability
- Rankings based on: (1) avg_overall_rating DESC, (2) review_count DESC
